### Results

Plots, logs and weights will autosave here upon training/testing.

I've included zipped archives of the main experiments from the report if you wish to see them. The archived logs
includes raw results, however bare in mind some of these may be noisy or old versions - I haven't pulled all the latest
logs from the school machine, sometimes just pulling the plots and reading results from these.

I haven't included the raw experimental plots because there's thousands and it will take up a lot of file space. Instead
I've included most of the custom plots and figures that were created using `ROC_plots.py` and `ggplots.r` for the report.
These are mainly what was used in the report as these compare models with each other on the same plots.
