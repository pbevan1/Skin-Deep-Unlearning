## Method:
 *"Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated dermatologist-level performance in the classification of melanoma and
 other skin lesions, but prediction irregularities due to bias are an issue that should be addressed before widespread
 deployment is possible. In this work, we robustly remove bias and spurious variation from an automated melanoma
 classification pipeline using two leading bias 'unlearning' techniques: 'Learning Not to Learn'
[[1]](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Kim_Learning_Not_to_Learn_Training_Deep_Neural_Networks_With_Biased_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf)
(LNTL) and 'Turning a Blind Eye' [[2]](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2018/Alvi18/alvi18.pdf) (TABE),
as well as an additional hybrid of the two (CLGR) . We show that the biases introduced
 by surgical markings and rulers presented in previous studies can be reasonably mitigated using these bias removal
 methods. We also demonstrate the generalisation benefits of 'unlearning' spurious variation relating to the
 imaging instrument used to capture lesion images. The novel contributions of this work include a comparison of
 different debiasing techniques for artefact bias removal and the concept of instrument bias 'unlearning' for
 domain generalisation in melanoma detection. Our experimental results provide evidence that the effect of each of the
 aforementioned biases are notably reduced, with different debiasing techniques excelling at different tasks."*
